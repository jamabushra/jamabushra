### Hello Earth ğŸ‘‹ Full Stack Web Developer 


<!--
**jamabushra/jamabushra** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a fullstack software developer, with a backround in sales consulting for early stage funding for startups.

Python & Javascript with a foundation in C++ are my tools of choice!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on THISWA and creating marketing tools small to medium businesses can use to optimise their digital engagement and presence.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN stack and it's deployment to create robust full scale applications

- âš¡ Fun fact: I was married by 22 and had my son at 23, no accident either ahah
